<b>MOTIVATIONAL YOUTUBE VIDEO CLASSIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE COMPARISION BASED ON TITLE</b>
<br>
<br>
YouTube is the most popular online video service for several years with billions 
of subscribers and viewers. There are several motivational channels on 
YouTube. Motivation is the word derived from the word ’motive’ which means 
needs, desires, wants, or drives within the individuals. There are two types of 
motivational videos on YouTube: i) Extrinsic motivation arises from outside of 
the individual and often involves external rewards such as trophies, money, 
social recognition, or praise. ii) Intrinsic motivation is internal and arises from 
within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword puzzle purely for 
the gratification of solving a problem. To overcome this problem, we present a 
natural language processing (NLP) based analysis approach for YouTube 
motivational videos. This classification helps in discovering intrinsic and extrinsic 
videos. After classifying the videos, we do a performance comparison on those 
titles using some common machine learning methods such as Support Vector 
Machine, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc. And also we use 
Deep Learning classifiers such as Convolution Neural Networks, Long Short-Term 
Memory, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc to compare for better performance 
analysis.
